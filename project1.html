    <p>A common problem/training theme in the workplace is health and safety prevention. Some health and safety measures can be life changing and it’s crucial for the instructional designer to determine whether this is a skill or knowledge deficiency to provide the appropriate intervention. </p>

    <p> Most people know the definition of a stroke but may not know all the signs or what to do in emergency situations. The job aid can provide lifesaving information without having to spend copious amounts of money on a formal training session.</p>

    <p> This job aid shows the signs and symptoms of a stroke and emphasizes the fact that it doesn’t have to be an elderly person. The job aid includes the CDC’s FAST test which helps a person determine whether or not a someone is having a stroke. The job aid includes visual examples of someone with facial drooping and body positioning. Additionally, the wording is brief to prevent cognitive overload. </p>

    <p>The overall goal of instructional design is to determine the root of the problem and create a method of eliminating it. Sometimes a simple learning solution can come from an illustration created in Photoshop. A successful job aid is one that features information that is legible, well-designed, comprehensive, and most importantly, applicable to the work environment. </p>
