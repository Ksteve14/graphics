    <p>Kirsten started her career in the field of education as a world language instructor, as she always had a knack of teaching and love of learning.
        After 3 years in the classroom, she witnessed the teaching profession drastically change and reevaluated her role in the field of education. Rather than let her teaching abilities go to waste, she combined her career experience with her creativity to become an instructional designer. </p>
    
    <p>For her graduate level coursework, she decided to step away from traditional k-12 content to explore new topics and professions such as the healthcare industry. Kirsten believes in creating content that is engaging, colorful, and encourages passion and curiosity for learning.</p>
