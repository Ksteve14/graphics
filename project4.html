    <p> Healthcare employees working with patients suffering from Alzheimer’s may become frustrated nor fully understand the effects of the disease. This can lead to miscommunication between the patient, other care workers, and family or friends of the patient. Alzheimer’s Disease is detrimental as it can affect a patient’s mood, behavior, coordination, and memory. A patient’s actions and behavior may change, and it can be difficult for those around them to comprehend what is happening to their loved ones and how to keep them safe.</p>
    <p>Many care providers and family members need to be observant of the patient’s environment and daily routine. Without taking in nutritional factors as well as the patient’s home life into consideration of the treatment plan, the care providers or loved ones can place themselves and the patient in danger.  </p>
    <p>E-Learning is a flexible training tool with a variety of benefits. Similar to tradition audiovisual learning, E-Learning allows users to work at a pace that suits their needs. Additionally, learning design programs such as Adobe Captivate add a level of interaction that is more interactive and engaging. From the perspective of an instructional designer, it’s recommended to use a storyboard and proposal plan to organize the structure and content of your E-Learning training program. This brainstorming period allows for the designer to experiment with different approaches for presenting the information as well as other visual elements. </p>
