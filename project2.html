    <p>For the usability application test, my group members and I chose to study the user experience of Duolingo. Close friends and family members were asked to carefully describe what it was like setting up an account and navigating the features of the application.  The purpose of Duolingo is to provide a user-friendly platform that makes learning a new language easy, effective, and engaging.</p>


    <p>The results were consistent, and the users stated that it was a pleasurable experience learning a foreign language with Duolingo. However, many users felt that they were guessing rather than applying their knowledge of the language. Additionally, the lack of text and explanation of the navigation features made it difficult for the users to complete tasks that required them to make adjustments to the application layout. </p>

    <p>Implementing a usability test offers a unique perspective for instructional designers to consider. For example, the usability test implemented in the Duolingo study measured task completion time as well as the appearance/navigation of the app. By analyzing these results and listening to the honest feedback of the users, instructional designers can determine the effectiveness of learning and make the necessary adjustments to create a stronger product in the future. </p>
